## Lyrics

```
i hope sincerely one day morbid certainty comes alive 
still thinking you want understanding at the end of your path
so closely missing points of conflict of our never finishing fights
dear you’ll be standing at my grave so clearly weeping tears of blood

It wasn’t me versus you, you versus me
It was the problem we clashed for at the core of our being 

```
